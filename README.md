# 👋 Hello, I'm @TemplarPirate!

### About Me
- 🧑‍💻 I'm a recreational therapist (CTRS) with a passion for creating innovative solutions using technology and DIY projects.
- 🎮 Currently exploring Linux, Raspberry Pi projects, and ham radio (KD5FPA).
- 📻 Amateur Radio Operator and APRS enthusiast, working on integrating my radio skills into a mobile micro-RV project.
- 🚗 Converting my 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe into a mobile office/micro RV with a solar-powered electrical system—complete with a Raspberry Pi-powered monitoring suite.
- 🛠️ Always learning: Whether it's Linux, electronics (I'm teaching myself to solder), or playing chess with a fierce Old Benoni Defense.
- 💡 Open to collaborating on tech, therapy, or recreational projects, especially if it involves innovative applications of therapy or hands-on builds.

### What I'm Up To
- 📡 Working on Raspberry Pi-powered APRS and telemetry reporting for my mobile office/micro-RV.
- 🔧 Experimenting with software-defined radio (SDR++) and other radio projects.
- 🌱 Diving deep into Linux and open-source tools to support my creative tech projects.

### Fun Fact
I once programmed a 'Magic 8 Ball' game on a TI-99/4A back in middle school—it was my first taste of coding, and I’ve been exploring tech ever since.
