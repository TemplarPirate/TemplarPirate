# 👋 Hello, I'm @TemplarPirate!

### About Me
- 👨‍👦‍👦 I’m a single dad with two magnificent sons, currently in the launch stage of parenting. Together, we explore many creative outlets, including **Dungeons & Dragons**!
- 🧑‍💻 I'm a **recreational therapist (CTRS)** in private practice with a passion for developing innovative, evidence-based practices to help others.
- 💡 As I get older, I’ve developed a growing passion for using **technology** in DIY projects, merging leisure and tech into creative solutions.
- 🎮 I’m currently exploring **Linux**, **Raspberry Pi** projects, and **ham radio** (KD5FPA), finding new ways to integrate these hobbies into my personal and professional life.
- 📻 As an **Amateur Radio Operator** and **APRS enthusiast**, I’m working on integrating radio skills into my mobile micro-RV project.
- 🚗 I’m converting my **2009 Hyundai Santa Fe** into a mobile office/micro RV with a solar-powered electrical system and a Raspberry Pi-powered monitoring suite.
- 🛠️ Always learning: From **electronics** (I’m teaching myself to solder) to **chess** (playing a fierce Old Benoni Defense), I’m always seeking new challenges.
- 💡 Open to collaborating on tech, **recreational therapy**, or leisure projects, especially if they involve innovative applications of therapy or hands-on builds.

### What I'm Up To
- 📡 **Recreational Therapy Resources**: I’ll be sharing various **RT tools** and **leisure experiences** that I’ve developed from my work as a recreational therapist, covering a wide range of therapeutic approaches.
- 🎲 **D&D Content**: My sons and I love **Dungeons & Dragons**, and I’ll be posting D&D homebrew content, character sheets, and campaign resources as part of our shared passion.
- 🛠️ **DIY & Tech Projects**: From **Raspberry Pi-powered APRS** and telemetry systems to Linux deep-dives and open-source tools, my projects span across tech and leisure.
  
### Fun Fact
I once programmed a 'Magic 8 Ball' game on a **TI-99/4A** in middle school—it sparked a lifelong curiosity in coding and tech, and I’ve been building on that ever since.
